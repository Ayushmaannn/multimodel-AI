    ## My Journey
    
    üöÄ **Inspiration**  
    It all started with an inspiring seminar at our college, where a team from [Rent Prompts](https://rentprompts.com)
    introduced us to the world of no-code AI model creation. The CEO and the team demonstrated how anyone can create
    and share AI models effortlessly. This hands-on workshop on text-to-text models was a game-changer.
    
    üîç **What We Learned**  
    Their platform allows users to define key parameters like **system prompts, user prompts, temperature, top-P, top-K,**
    and **token limits** to fine-tune AI models. Seeing this, I was so fascinated that I decided to replicate
    their approach and create my own version of a similar platform using **Streamlit**.
    
    üí° **Creation**  
    With my prior knowledge and the support of tools like **ChatGPT**, I built this project as a learning experience
    and a tribute to their vision. This is an ongoing experiment, and while it may not be perfect, I hope it serves
    as an inspiration for others to dive into AI and explore its possibilities.
